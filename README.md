#Purpose and Overview of the Project

Purpose of our project is to predict protein secondary structures and visualize the result. Our
product is a secondary structure protein prediction program, relying on the support vector
machine module for machine learning.

The secondary structures of proteins can fall into 3 general categories: Alpha helix, beta sheet
and coil. These secondary structures will largely determine the biological function of the protein.
Current sequencing techniques make it so that we can determine the amino acid sequence of
proteins at a quicker rate than the respective proteins 3-D structure.
This system consists of three modules: StructureExplorer, StructurePrediction and
p3editPDB/ProteinViewer.
